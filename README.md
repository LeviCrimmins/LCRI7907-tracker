# LCRI7907 Walk Tracker

## Overview
My application â€“ WalkTrackr, is the ultimate tracking tool for monitoring your walks and allowing you to progress and see real improvements in your overall health and fitness journey.
WalkTrackr is designed to help users maintain or gain a healthy lifestyle and allows them to engage with a comprehensive tracking solution tailored to their individual needs. Whether the user is a seasoned walker who has been on a hike or 2, or a newbie who is just getting into the exercise, WalkTrackr provides them with what they need to progress, stay motivated and achieve their goals along their journey. 
This Single-Page Application allows you to track your walks and uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as local storage to track your journey.

### Version Control
This project uses git and github for tracking changes and managing development. Please see my github repository here: https://github.com/LeviCrimmins/LCRI7907-tracker.git

## Features
- **Workout Tracker:** Record your workout stats for later
- **Stats** Graphs that track and display your workout data
- **Previous Workouts** A list of previous workouts that you have recorded for you to look back on to view improvement
- **Data Persistence** This Application uses `localStorage` to remember your workout history

## Setup
I have used chart.js so internet connection is required to fetch the library from CDN. 

## Usage 

1. Open the `index.html` file to begin
2. Once the page is open, record a few workouts using the input boxes and then scroll down to view the graphs. The inputs can be deleted if not needed anymore or if you made a mistake

## Limitations
This application uses `localStorage` meaning it is only recording data on the specific device or browser you are currently using, therefore meaning it cannot transfer data between devices/ browsers.
